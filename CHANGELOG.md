# Changelog

Each release of Research-Kit, newest first. The version is `KIT_VERSION` in
`research-kit/lib/core.mjs`; a release is tagged `v<version>` (ADR-0116).

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-01

The first tagged release.

**What it is.** A zero-dependency Node toolkit that makes research a blocking phase before
an agent builds anything:
- unknowns are named in a contract (`research/DISCOVERY.md`);
- primary pages are fetched into a hash-chained, append-only ledger;
- claims are tied to quotes the gate finds in the captured pages;
- a commit gate refuses product code until preflight passes;
- the result is handed to the builder as `research/BRIEF.md`.

**Collection.** Firecrawl (metered), a keyless HTTP transport, and a local-Chromium browser
transport, with SerpAPI, SearXNG and DuckDuckGo-lite for search. Remote collection runs on
GitHub Actions (`collect-remote`, with `--run-id` to pick a run up again).

**Hardening in this release.** Dozens of break-test rounds. The latest:
- the commit hook judges a commit even when `git diff` fails;
- every hook git knows hands on to what git would have run without the kit (ADR-0112,
  ADR-0113);
- `install` refuses to mirror into a folder that is not a kit (ADR-0111);
- the keyless fetch judges the address it connects to, closing DNS rebinding (ADR-0114);
- the browser transport checks a URL's redirects before Chromium starts (ADR-0115);
- writes retry a rename Windows holds for a moment.

**Supported.** Linux and Windows, Node 22, 24 and 26, all tested on every commit. macOS is
best-effort with no CI leg (ADR-0101).

**Known limits.**
- The gate proves evidence was fetched and quoted, not that it was read correctly: the
  review is the agent's own declaration (ADR-0107).
- The edit-time gate is a Claude Code hook; other agents meet only the commit gate.
- Navigation a page makes after it loads is not checked by the browser transport (ADR-0115).

**License.** All rights reserved (`LICENSE`).
