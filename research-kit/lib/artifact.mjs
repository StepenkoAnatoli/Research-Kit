// artifact.mjs - packaging a project into the portable artifact, without changing it.
//
// THE PRODUCER DOES NOT TAKE AUTHORIZATION AS INPUT.
//
// There is no `--build-authorized` flag and there will not be one. Every field that could
// let a consumer start building - `state`, `kind`, `buildAuthorized`, `review.*`, `gate.*`
// - is DERIVED here from the project on disk, by running the kit's own gate and reading
// the kit's own artifacts. A caller supplies identity (which repository, which run) and
// nothing about permission.
//
// The reason is the whole point of the format. A ZIP travels: from a runner to an
// artifact store to somebody's Downloads folder to an agent's working directory. At every
// hop the only thing standing between "evidence was collected" and "you may build" is
// what this manifest says. If a caller could assert it, the assertion would be the
// easiest field in the system to set and the most expensive one to get wrong.
//
// WHAT IS DERIVABLE, AND WHAT IS NOT.
//
// `mapClassified` and `briefReviewed` have honest machine answers: a map row either
// carries a status or it does not, and `briefState` already distinguishes an authored
// brief from a draft with TODOs in it. `findingsReviewed` has no general answer - ADR-0013
// and ADR-0017 record that judging whether an agent reasoned properly would be wrong - but
// it has a specific NEGATIVE one, and that is enough: re-run the extractor over the
// cached capture, and a Finding cell still byte-identical to what the extractor produces
// was demonstrably never rewritten. That detects the unreviewed case without pretending
// to grade the reviewed one.
