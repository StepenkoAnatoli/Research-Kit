// One unknown, everything it rests on, in one read-only answer.

// The work this replaces is real and repetitive: to judge whether U-5 is actually closed
// you open DISCOVERY.md for its wording, EVIDENCE.md for the rows it cites, SOURCES.md
// for what each source is, research/raw/ for the captured page, and the ledger for when
// it was fetched — five files and a lot of scrolling, every time, for every unknown.
//
// It answers, and it decides NOTHING. No status is read as a judgement, no status is
// written, and a missing piece is reported as missing rather than filled in. Whether the
// evidence closes the unknown stays a person's call — that is the whole protocol, and a
// tool that quietly rendered a verdict here would be the most dangerous thing in the kit.
