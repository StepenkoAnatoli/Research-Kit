/**
 * How many independent readings does a closed unknown rest on?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every check before it asks whether a claim is BACKED - is there a row,
 * is there a capture, does the chain verify, is it fresh, is it primary. None of them asks
 * whether it is backed more than once, so a corpus in which every unknown rested on a
 * single page passed preflight and `--strict` with nothing to say about it. From inside
 * such a corpus, a single CORRECT source and a single LUCKY one are indistinguishable.
 *
 * Found in this repository's own delivery-architecture corpus on 2026-09-21: nine rows,
 * all primary, all complete, all fresh - and eight unknowns each resting on exactly one of
 * them. Three of those eight carried architecture decisions.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A WARNING. Single-sourcing is often the right answer: a vendor's own API
 * reference is the authority on that API, and demanding a second opinion about it would be
 * ceremony. This check refuses to make that judgement - it reports the shape of the
 * support so a reviewer can make it. `evidencePolicy=strict` or `--strict` is where an
 * operator says they want the harder rule.
 *
 * WHY THE HOST MATTERS. Two pages from one vendor are not two witnesses. They are one
 * witness read twice, which catches a misreading and cannot catch a vendor being wrong
 * about itself. The finding says which of those it found, because the remedies differ:
 * one wants another page, the other wants another party.
 */
/**
 * A reviewer's recorded judgement that an unknown has ONE witness and cannot have two.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `corroboration` reports the shape of support and leaves the judgement
 * to a reviewer (ADR-0036) - but it gave the reviewer nowhere to put the judgement. So a
 * claim that had been considered and correctly left single-sourced looked exactly like one
 * nobody had looked at twice, forever, and `evidencePolicy=strict` was unsatisfiable by
 * any corpus containing an honest one.
 *
 * WHY A REASON IS REQUIRED, and why that is the whole mechanism: this is the same shape
 * `MAP.md` already uses for `DISMISSED` and `completeness: partial` uses for `omitted` -
 * you may overrule the default, and you must say why in writing that survives in the
 * corpus. The check does not grade the reason (ADR-0013); it requires one to exist and
 * shows it in the finding, so the judgement is auditable rather than invisible.
