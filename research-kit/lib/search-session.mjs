// search-session.mjs - one search session asks the providers, for every coordinator (ADR-0135).
//
// The ONE owner of how a query is put to the search providers: every provider under a merge
// (interleaved by rank and attributed), otherwise the one provider with one bounded degrade
// to the fetch provider's own search; the rate-limit patience; the meters (`searchesUsed`,
// `searchesOn`, `searchCreditsEstimate`, `searchFailures`, `searchFailuresOn`, `degraded`);
// one failure row per failed ask, handed to the coordinator's sink; and the refusal of a
// provider that cannot run, before anything is spent.
//
// `runResearch` (phase 1) and `decompose` (phase 0) each carried a copy of this loop, and
// read side by side on 2026-10-03 the copies had drifted in six places - a failed ask
// counted in one and not the other, a usage label spelled two ways, a refusal one had and
// one lacked (ADR-0135 lists them). What the coordinator makes of an answer - which results
// become targets, which are material, what an empty answer means - stays the coordinator's.

/**
 * Interleave several providers' results by RANK, not by concatenation.
 *
 * WHY RANK AND NOT ORDER. On 2026-09-22 a search for the EU Deforestation Regulation
 * returned, from one provider, eight pages about US financial regulation and nothing about
 * the subject - while the other returned seventeen, all on topic. Concatenating would have
 * let the failing provider spend the entire page budget before the working one was reached.
 * Round-robin bounds that: each provider contributes its best result, then its second, and
 * a provider that is wholly wrong costs at most its share.
 *
 * `provider` is carried on every row so the ledger records WHICH search surfaced a URL -
 * that is how a claim about search quality stays checkable afterwards instead of being an
 * impression.
 *
 * EVERY finder is recorded, not the first one. The initial version credited whichever
 * provider came first in the round - always the same one, since the order is fixed - and
 * its comment claimed that agreement therefore did not inflate the count. It did, and a
 * live run proved it: sixteen results, nine distinct, so seven URLs were returned by both
 * and all seven were attributed to the provider that happened to be asked first. Six of
 * eight collected rows then read as that provider's finds.
 *
 * That is provenance which reads as a measurement and is really an artefact of loop order -
 * precisely the kind of number this repository keeps catching itself quoting. `provider` is
 * the first finder, `providers` is all of them, and a row both returned says so.
