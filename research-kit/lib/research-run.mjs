/**
 * How much of the topic's own vocabulary appears in what was just collected.
 *
 * REPORTED, NEVER ENFORCED, and the measurement that settled that is worth keeping.
 *
 * It exists because a collection can return eight captures about the wrong subject and pass
 * every structural check in the kit. On 2026-09-22 a run on the EU Deforestation Regulation
 * returned SEC filings, CFPB regulations and California water boards - the search had
 * matched the word "regulation" - and `preflight` had nothing to say, because no check asks
 * whether the evidence is about the topic.
 *
 * Two thresholds were measured against that failure and every committed corpus here:
 *
 *   PER CAPTURE, share >= 0.5: rejected. It flags RFC 9728 in the agent-interface corpus,
 *   which never says "MCP" - and not saying it is exactly what makes it an independent
 *   witness. The rule would punish the best evidence in the corpus.
 *
 *   PER CORPUS, at least one capture >= 0.5: rejected too, and this is the decisive one.
 *   `delivery-architecture` scores max 0.25 with zero strong captures - IDENTICAL to the
 *   failure - because its topic is "How Research-Kit should be delivered to a non-technical
 *   user" and its evidence is GitHub Actions documentation. Semantically related, lexically
 *   disjoint. No threshold separates that from a corpus about the wrong subject entirely.
 *
 * Telling those apart needs meaning, which ADR-0013 refuses. So the number is printed at the
 * moment it helps - right after collecting, before anyone has read the pages - and decides
 * nothing. A reviewer seeing 0.25 on a fresh collection knows to check the URLs; on the EUDR
 * run that is precisely the step that caught it, performed by hand.
 *
 * A HIGH SCORE MEANS NOTHING WHEN THE TOPIC IS MADE OF COMMON WORDS, and that is not
 * hypothetical either. The first real use after shipping was a collection on Tavily's terms,
 * topic "...data retention training on inputs outputs zero retention enterprise tier opt
 * out". It reported **0.92, eight of eight above threshold** - on a corpus where SEVEN OF
 * EIGHT captures were generic "zero data retention" marketing from unrelated vendors and
 * only `tavily.com/terms` was on topic. Every one of those pages genuinely contains "data",
 * "retention", "training", "zero" and "enterprise", so the arithmetic was right and the
 * signal was useless.
 *
 * So the number is informative in ONE direction only: a low score is worth investigating,
 * and a high score is worth nothing unless the topic carried distinctive terms. `deforestation`
 * and `2023/1115` are distinctive; `data` and `service` are not, and this function cannot
 * tell the difference without a corpus-wide notion of rarity it does not have.
