// lib/browser-transport.mjs - render a page with a local Chromium, from the command line
// (ADR-0088). Research: docs/decisions/2026-09-28-browser-transport.
//
// Free, keyless and dependency-free: `--headless --dump-dom <url>` prints the rendered DOM
// (E-01, E-02), and the keyless transport's own extractor turns it into a graded capture, so
// both transports grade pages by one rule. It reads what the keyless transport cannot: on
// 2026-09-28 a GitHub Discussion answered the keyless client HTTP 403 and rendered here in full.
//
// Fetch only. It does not search; a run on it searches with the keyless route (transport.mjs).
//
// Every request Chromium makes goes through a guard proxy the kit runs (ADR-0118), in a child
// process (`browser-guard.mjs`): a page on the web cannot send the browser into this machine's
// network, whether by a redirect, a script, a meta refresh or an image.
