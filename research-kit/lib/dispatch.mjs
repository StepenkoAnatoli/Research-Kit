// dispatch.mjs - asking the collector to run, from outside GitHub.
//
// This is the seam an AI agent or a desktop app uses. It does four things: start a run,
// learn which run it started, wait for it, and bring the artifact home. Nothing here
// judges research; the artifact validator does that, and this module hands off to it.
//
// THE TOKEN IS READ FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND NEVER FROM AN ARGUMENT.
//
// A token on a command line is in the shell history, in `ps` output, in any CI log that
// echoes its own command, and in the crash report of anything that dumps argv. There is
// no flag for it and `tokenFromEnv` is the only way in, so there is no path where a caller
// can put one somewhere it will be recorded. Every error message here goes through
// `redact`, because the most common way a credential escapes is an exception that quoted
// the request that carried it.
//
// THE API VERSION IS PINNED, AND A MISSING RUN ID IS A NAMED FAILURE.
//
// Under `2022-11-28` - still GitHub's default - the dispatch endpoint returns `204 No
// Content` and the caller cannot learn which run it started. Under `2026-03-10` it returns
// `200` with `workflow_run_id`. This module pins the second and treats a 204 as a specific,
// explained error rather than as an empty success, because "the run started and I have no
// idea which one" is the failure a caller is least equipped to diagnose from a status code.
