//
// One remedy PER CAUSE. Something that did not travel lives on the collector; a corpus
// that travelled whole and was rewritten on checkout lives here; a ledger emptied beside
// its captures is restored from git or re-collected, never pushed; a capture changed after
// its fetch is restored from the commit, or on the collector when the change was committed.
// One blanket text for all of them is what used to send operators to re-collect a corpus
