// serpapi.mjs - a SEARCH-ONLY provider (ADR-0027).
//
// The first module in this kit that satisfies one contract rather than the whole adapter
// shape. It searches. It cannot fetch a page, says so by name when asked, and never
// produces a capture - so nothing here ever reaches the fetch ledger.
//
// Why it exists: search and fetch drew on one free allowance, so every search spent was
// a page not fetched (E-03, E-14). This is a second meter, not a cheaper one.
//
// Three vendor facts shape every decision below, each read off the captured API
// reference rather than assumed:
//   - `api_key` is Required and travels as a QUERY PARAMETER. That is the worst place a
//     secret can live, so it is never rendered, never logged, and scrubbed out of vendor
//     error text before anyone sees it.
//   - There is no documented result-count parameter. Only `start`, for pagination. We
//     send neither and slice locally - a response costs the same whatever it carries
//     ("responses with 100 results or empty result sets will both count as 1 search"),
//     so asking for fewer buys nothing. Three defects in this project have come from
//     assuming a vendor parameter; this is the cheap way not to add a fourth.
//   - `no_cache` defaults to false and a repeated identical query is served from
//     SerpAPI's own cache for an hour, free and uncounted. We never send it.
//
// Pure Node ESM, no dependencies. `fetch` is async and the adapter shape is synchronous,
// so this module re-execs ITSELF with a JSON job on stdin - the same child-process
// rendezvous `http-transport.mjs` uses. The key travels on that pipe rather than in argv
// or the environment, so it never appears in the process table.
