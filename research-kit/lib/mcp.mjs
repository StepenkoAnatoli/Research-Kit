// mcp.mjs - the collector as a Model Context Protocol server.
//
// EVERY DESIGN CHOICE HERE IS CITED, because this module is the first thing in the
// repository built from an approved brief rather than from a plan. The brief is
// `docs/decisions/2026-09-21-agent-interface/research/BRIEF.md`; the E-numbers below are
// its evidence rows, and each one points at a cached page anybody can re-read.
//
// STDIO, NOT STREAMABLE HTTP (E-01, E-03).
//
// "Protocol semantics are identical on every transport" (E-03), so this is an operational
// choice rather than a capability one. A stdio server is a subprocess the client launches
// on the operator's own machine; a remote one needs the whole OAuth 2.1 chain before an
// agent can say hello - a 401 with `WWW-Authenticate`, a Protected Resource Metadata
// document, authorization-server discovery, client registration or DCR, and a browser
// consent round trip (E-01). That is an identity product. Nothing asked for one.
//
// THE CREDENTIAL IS THE ONE WE ALREADY HAVE (E-01).
//
// "For MCP servers using the STDIO transport, you can use environment-based credentials"
// - so `tokenFromEnv` is not a shortcut here, it is the documented route. No token
// reaches a tool argument, and `x-mcp-header` is deliberately unused: the tools spec
// warns developers SHOULD NOT mark tokens that way "as header values are visible to
// network intermediaries" (E-04).
//
// TWO TOOLS, NOT ONE.
//
// `collect` starts a run and returns its id; `fetch_corpus` takes that id and returns a
// link. A server "cannot initiate JSON-RPC requests" (E-03), so there is no "I will call
// you back" - the alternative to two calls is one call held open for several minutes, and
// an agent whose process dies mid-call has then lost a run it paid for. Two calls give it
// something to retry against.
//
// A LINK, NEVER THE BYTES (E-04).
//
// A corpus ZIP is tens of kilobytes. `resource_link` returns a URI the client fetches,
// and embedding is permitted but the specification "states no maximum size anywhere" - so
// a `file://` URI is the defensible option rather than the merely available one.
//
// THE PROTOCOL VERSION IS PINNED (E-05).
//
// Version is declared per request with no handshake; a server that cannot serve one MUST
// answer `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` (-32022) listing what it does support. Same
// discipline as pinning `X-GitHub-Api-Version` on the GitHub side, for the same reason:
// this protocol has already broken compatibility once.

/**
 * DUAL-ERA, and the reason is that the specification is ahead of every client.
 *
 * E-05 splits the world: **modern** revisions (`2026-07-28` and later) carry version and
 * capabilities as per-request metadata; **legacy** ones (`2025-11-25` and earlier)
 * establish a session with an `initialize` handshake. It names the third option too - "a
 * **dual-era** implementation that supports both".
 *
 * The first version of this server implemented modern only, correctly, from the
 * specification. It could not be called by anything that exists. The official SDK at
 * v1.30.0 declares LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION `2025-11-25` and opens with `initialize`, so
 * driving this server with it produced, in full:
 *
 *     MCP error -32601: unknown method initialize
 *
 * A server nothing can call is not a conformant server, it is an unreachable one. Same
 * shape as building the workflow against an npm package named `firecrawl`: read from the
 * documentation, never exercised against reality, wrong in the one way that matters.
