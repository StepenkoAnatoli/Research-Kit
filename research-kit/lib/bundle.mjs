// bundle.mjs - the received archive, and how far this repository has moved from it.
//
// This project began as a ZIP of 80 planning documents. `BUNDLE_INDEX.md` carries their
// SHA-256 digests, and ADR-0022 read that as a constraint: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` was a
// "byte-preserved bundle source", so it must not be edited, so the same-commit map rule
// (ADR-0007) had to be given an exception.
//
// ADR-0028 supersedes that. The manifest is a RECORD OF A PAST STATE, not a promise about
// the present - and treating it as a promise cost something real: three commits took
// `--no-verify` to get past a rule that was catching genuine documentation drift.
//
// So the digests stay frozen, exactly as the archive arrived, and this module makes the
// record CHECKABLE instead of decorative. Nothing read `BUNDLE_INDEX.md` before; its
// hashes had never once been verified by anything. Now drift is reported - which file,
// and whether its change is expected - rather than assumed absent.
