 *
 * Found 2026-10-03 (output-reliability audit, G7): every body was decoded as UTF-8 whatever
 * Content-Type said, so a `charset=windows-1252` page holding byte 0x80 came back with
 * U+FFFD where the euro sign was - silently, and the capture's hash then proved a page the
 * server never sent. The rules, in this order (the later ones from the review of that fix,
 * the same day):
 *  - a byte-order mark outranks the header: a UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM is the file saying what
 *    it is, and a server that mislabels a BOM'd file is common; the decoder drops the mark.
 *  - a label TextDecoder does not know (it knows the WHATWG labels - windows-1252,
 *    iso-8859-1, shift_jis, ... - on a Node built with full ICU, as Node 22+ is) means the
 *    body is read as UTF-8, the only honest choice left; that is a named fallback when a byte
 *    outside ASCII is present, and an exact reading when none is.
 *  - a UTF-8 label, or none, reads as UTF-8, as it always did; bytes that are not valid UTF-8
 *    under it are a named fallback, because a page that names its charset only in a <meta>
 *    tag arrives exactly so, and U+FFFD where its euro sign was is not the page.
 *  - a UTF-16 label over a body with no NUL byte is not believed: UTF-16 text of any page
 *    holds one for every ASCII character, and an 8-bit body read as UTF-16 is CJK garbage
 *    from end to end. Such a body is read as UTF-8 - exact when it is valid UTF-8, a named
 *    fallback when it is not.
 *  - a legacy label over bytes that form valid UTF-8 is read as UTF-8: a server default of
 *    iso-8859-1 in front of files written as UTF-8 is the common misconfiguration, and bytes
 *    outside ASCII that form valid UTF-8 are almost never intended as Latin-1 text. The
