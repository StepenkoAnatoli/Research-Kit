"""Shared primitives for the Python conformance runners.

Every runner here answers the same question a Node runner answers, about the same vector
packet, and the answers must match. That only holds if they canonicalise identically --
and until 2026-09-20 they did not.

Three runners each carried their own copy. Two hand-wrote `canonical_json` byte for byte
identically; the third called `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`, which is a different
algorithm. The divergence was real and provable:

    {"a": 1.0}    Node -> {"a":1}      sha 015abd7f...
                  fi   -> {"a":1.0}    sha c29a44ab...
    {"a": -0.0}   Node -> {"a":0}      sha 45b619e9...
                  fi   -> {"a":-0.0}   sha 952b7dc4...

Cross-language agreement held only because no FI vector contained a float. A suite that
compares 28 chosen inputs does not establish that two functions agree; it establishes
that they agree on 28 inputs.

Standard library only, like the runners it serves.
