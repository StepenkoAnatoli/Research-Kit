// bin/mcp-server.mjs - the collector, as a Model Context Protocol server over stdio.
//
// Launched as a subprocess by an MCP client, which speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC on
// this process's standard streams. There are no flags: a stdio server's configuration is
// its environment, and the one thing it needs is a GitHub token.
//
// STDOUT IS THE MESSAGE STREAM AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// A stray `console.log` here corrupts the protocol - the client reads a line, fails to
// parse it, and the failure looks like a malformed response to whatever request happened
// to be in flight. Every diagnostic below goes to stderr, deliberately.
//
// Register it with a client roughly like this:
//
//   {
//     "mcpServers": {
//       "research-kit": {
//         "command": "node",
//         "args": ["<path>/research-kit/bin/mcp-server.mjs"],
//         "env": { "RESEARCH_KIT_GITHUB_TOKEN": "github_pat_..." }
//       }
//     }
//   }
//
// The token needs exactly one permission - Actions: read and write, on the one repository
// holding the collector workflow. See the front-page README.

Speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout.
Protocol versions: ${SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.join(', ')} - modern and legacy, because every
shipped client still opens with the legacy initialize handshake.
Tools: ${TOOLS.map((t) => t.name).join(', ')}.

The token is read from ${TOKEN_VARS.join(' or ')}. There is no token argument: a stdio
server's credential belongs in its environment, which is what the MCP specification says
for this transport.

A corpus this server returns is EVIDENCE, not approved research. Read buildAuthorized.

// A stdio server's configuration is its environment, so it takes NO options - and an
// option it does not take must be refused rather than ignored.
//
// Silence is the dangerous default, and this project has paid for it: `research.mjs
// --totally-made-up-flag` was run to find out whether unknown flags were refused, they
// were not, it fell through to its default behaviour and spent 26 Firecrawl credits on a
// real collection. `refuseUnknownFlags` in lib/core.mjs is the remedy everywhere else,
// but it cannot be used here: it needs a list of the flags an entrypoint DOES accept,
// and this one accepts none, so its "known options" list would be empty and every
// invocation including `--help` (handled above) would be refused.
//
// Two real ways this bites. A client configured with `--directory /some/project` - the
// spelling every other MCP server takes - gets a server that ignores it and collects
// somewhere else, silently. And a token passed as `--token <secret>` puts a credential
// in the process table, is discarded just as silently, and the server then reports
// "no token" and refuses every tool - a permission error that looks like the kit's fault.
