Write two things: what you expect the evidence to say, and what you know you cannot know
yet. At least ${MIN_PRIOR} characters, which is a floor and not a judgement - nothing here
grades the prediction, and a prior that turns out wrong has done its job.

It is stored in ${PRIOR_PATH} and chained into the fetch ledger, so its position before the
first collected page is not editable afterwards, and neither is its text.

One per corpus, and only before the first page is collected. A prediction registered with
the evidence already in hand is not a prediction; write what you now believe in the brief,
where it is labelled as hindsight.
