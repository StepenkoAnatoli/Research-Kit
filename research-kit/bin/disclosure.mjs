// Sends unauthenticated requests to a repository you name and reports what a stranger can
// read. There is no token flag and no credential is read from the environment: a probe
// that quietly authenticated would answer a different question and look like this one.
//
// Exit codes are the finding, so this can gate something later:
//   0  only the SHAPE is public - names, sizes, timings
//   1  CONTENT is public - artifacts or logs can be read by a stranger
//   2  the SUBJECT is public - the topic you passed was found in a public response
//   3  could not measure

  node research-kit/bin/disclosure.mjs --repository OWNER/REPO --run <id> [--topic "<text>"]

  --repository OWNER/REPO   required
  --run <id>                the workflow run to probe   (required)
  --topic "<text>"          the subject whose appearance would mean it leaked
  --json                    machine-readable report

Every request is UNAUTHENTICATED, on purpose: the question is what somebody with no
relationship to the repository can read. There is no token flag.

Exit: 0 shape only, 1 content readable, 2 subject leaked, 3 could not measure.
