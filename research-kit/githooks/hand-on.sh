# research-kit: hand a hook on to what git would have run without the kit (ADR-0112).
# Sourced by every hook in this folder; not a hook itself - git runs only hook names.
#
# git runs hooks from ONE folder, and the kit's install made it this one. Before that, git ran
# the folder core.hooksPath held - recorded by the install as research-kit.previousHooksPath -
# or, with none, the repository's own hooks. hand_on runs that hook, with the same arguments
# and stdin, and returns 0 when there is none.
#
# --git-common-dir, not --git-path hooks: with core.hooksPath set, the latter names this
# folder, and the hook would call itself.
