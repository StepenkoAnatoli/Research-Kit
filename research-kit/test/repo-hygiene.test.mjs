// path that reaches the index once is tracked forever, silently, no matter what the
// ignore file says.
//
// The consequence was small per occurrence and endless in aggregate: `bin/gate.mjs`
// appends a line to that file on every invocation, so every commit-gate run, every
// edit-gate run, and every verification left the working tree dirty. A read-only check
// that modifies the repository it is checking is a contradiction, and under branch
// protection it becomes an obstruction as well.
//
// Neither the kit's tests nor its own gate could see it: both judge the corpus, and this
// is a fact about git's index.
