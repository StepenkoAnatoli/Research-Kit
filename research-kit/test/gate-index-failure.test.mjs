// What the commit gate does when it CANNOT read the index.
//
// The gate's contract is that it judges the bytes being committed (ADR-0024). Until
// 2026-09-21, a git failure while materialising the index made it judge the working tree
// instead, note that it had done so, and carry on to a normal verdict.
//
// Noting it is not enough. The two sources differ exactly when it matters: stage a corpus
// with an unproven unknown, fix it only in the working tree, and a gate reading the tree
// passes a commit whose staged contents it never saw. That is the defect ADR-0024 exists
// to prevent, reintroduced by an environmental failure rather than by a code path - and
// an environmental failure is the case nobody is watching for.
