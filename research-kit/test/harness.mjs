// --- this suite does not inherit the git context it was started in -----------------
//
// GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE and their kin are how git redirects EVERY child git process to
// a repository other than the one its cwd names. From git's own mouth - a hook, which
// receives GIT_INDEX_FILE and is judged on that index - they are the data path. Arriving
// in THIS process they are ambient state from wherever the suite was started: a wrapper
// that exported GIT_DIR once and never unset it, a hook that runs the tests, an editor
// integration. Every scratch repository the suite builds is then bypassed, and its
// fixture commits land in the repository the variables name instead (found 2026-09-28,
// break-test: with GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE exported, `git add -A -f` in hook.test.mjs's
// fixture staged this repository's own __pycache__ and COMMITTED to it - 16 red tests,
// and a "the corpus" commit on a branch nobody asked for).
//
// So the suite removes them from its own process before any test runs, and says so on
// stderr: a variable silently ignored is a variable nobody learns to unset. The commit
// gate itself (bin/gate.mjs) deliberately still honours these - it runs from inside
// git's hook, where they point at the repository being committed. The suite is the
// opposite case: it judges this checkout and its own scratch repositories, never a
// repository named by the environment it happened to be started in.
