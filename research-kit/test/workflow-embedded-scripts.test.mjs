// The JavaScript embedded in workflow YAML must actually be JavaScript.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, precisely.
//
// The first live collection died on this line:
//
//   console.log(`::warning::client_ref "${value}" is PUBLIC: it is this run's name ...`)
//
// Every `node -e '...'` block in a workflow is a SINGLE-QUOTED SHELL STRING. A single
// quote inside it ends the string, so the apostrophe in "run's" handed node a truncated
// program and the step failed with `Unterminated template`. It cost no credits only
// because it happened to sit before the credential check.
//
// The existing workflow tests could not have caught it. They assert properties of the
// YAML as TEXT - that a string is present, that an input is not interpolated - and this
// defect is invisible at that level: the text was exactly what was intended. The bug is
// in what the shell does to the text before node sees it.
//
// So this file does the one thing text assertions cannot: it extracts each embedded
// script the way the shell would deliver it, and parses it. A syntax error here is a step
// that will fail on a runner, found offline instead of after an approval.
