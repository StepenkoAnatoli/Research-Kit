// docs/ARCHITECTURE.md is the CURRENT map. These check that it stays one.
//
// The commit gate already requires the map to be STAGED with a code change, and is
// deliberately modest about it: a whitespace edit satisfies the gate, which makes a stale
// map a deliberate act rather than mere forgetting. That is a prompt, not a proof.
//
// These are the proof, for the parts that can be proved. They check structure and
// coverage - every module has an owner, every count matches the filesystem - and NOT
// prose. A test that greps for a sentence pins the wording instead of the fact, and goes
// red when someone improves a paragraph.
//
// On 2026-09-20 the map was split: what exists now stayed, why it exists moved to
// docs/architecture-history/ and the ADRs. The split is what surfaced the third
// documentation drift in this repository - the map said "11 checks in the registry" on
// one line and "12 named checks" in the diagram twelve lines above it.
