// This was the one limit left after the three validation gaps closed, and the reason
// given for it was sloppy. Two different things were being conflated:
//
//   - Running it ONCE costs a couple of credits. That was never blocked.
//   - Running it on EVERY `selftest.mjs` costs a couple of credits every time, for
//     every developer, forever. That is the real constraint.
//
// So the test exists and is opted into, rather than not existing. Off by default, it
// registers a single test that checks the gate is actually closed - so the file is never
// dead code and the mechanism itself is covered. On, it runs the real thing.
//
//   RESEARCH_KIT_LIVE=1 SERPAPI_API_KEY=... node research-kit/bin/selftest.mjs

// It scaffolds a temp project and runs there, so a live run never touches this
// repository's own corpus.
