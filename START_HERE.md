# Start here

For me, the operator. Not for the AI.

## Where things live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| The kit itself | `C:\Users\PC\.agents\research-kit` — installed once, never moves |
| Research for THIS project | `<project folder>\research\` — working files, leave alone |
| My one pasteable file | `<project folder>\research\audits\` — named by topic + version + date |

Nothing gets copied between folders. Each project keeps its own research,
inside itself.

---

## Starting new research

1. **Open the project folder** — the actual project (e.g. `AGent teacher`),
   never the kit's own folder.
2. **Say what I want researched.** The agent reads the skill automatically
   and starts.
3. **When it's done, ask for the audit** — that's my one file:
   ```
   node C:\Users\PC\.agents\research-kit\bin\audit.mjs
   ```
   Written to `research\audits\` in the project folder.

If I'm ever unsure which folder I'm in, check before starting — the agent
should ask if it isn't sure, not go searching my disk.

---

## Picking up where I left off

From inside the project folder:

```
node C:\Users\PC\.agents\research-kit\bin\doctor.mjs
node C:\Users\PC\.agents\research-kit\bin\preflight.mjs
git log --oneline -5
git status
```

Then tell Claude to resume. Nothing committed is ever lost, and credits
already spent are not spent again.

---

## If something looks broken

```
node C:\Users\PC\.agents\research-kit\bin\doctor.mjs
```

It names every problem and prints the exact fix. Run it, fix what it says,
run it again. Stop at READY.

## Budget

1,000 Firecrawl credits a month. Resets monthly. Stops cleanly at zero —
no surprise charges. A research cycle is roughly 40 credits.

## The rules the AI follows

Live in `AGENTS.md` inside the kit and every project it touches. I don't
need to know them — any AI that opens the repo is bound by them.
