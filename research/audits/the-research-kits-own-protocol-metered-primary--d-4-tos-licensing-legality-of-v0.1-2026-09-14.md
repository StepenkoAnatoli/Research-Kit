# The research kit's own protocol: metered primary-source collection, provenance, and gate — Subtopic D-4: ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use (Audit v0.1)

_Generated 2026-09-14. Subtopic of **The research kit's own protocol: metered primary-source collection, provenance, and gate**. Evidence window: 2026-09-13. Version 0.1._

## Executive Summary

This audit compiles 1 verified finding about **D-4 — ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use** (subtopic of The research kit's own protocol: metered primary-source collection, provenance, and gate) from 1 primary-source page cached under `research/raw/`. Every relevant blocking unknown has primary-source evidence; none remain open. Top finding: By registering and using the Services, you represent and warrant you: (i) have the authority and capacity to enter this Agreement; (ii) are at least 18 years old, or 13 years or older and have the express permission of….

## How to use this file

This file is a self-contained audit of the **D-4 — ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use** subtopic. It can be pasted into an AI on its own; its parent main-topic audit (`the-research-kits-own-protocol-metered-primary-v0.1-2026-09-14.md`) covers the full project.

## Decision

**TODO** — fill in the Decision section of `research/BRIEF.md` (what to build first and what is explicitly out of scope) and re-run `node bin/audit.mjs` to refresh the audit.

## Next steps

1. Review **Contradictions** and **Decision** in `research/BRIEF.md`; if they are TODO, no builder should start yet.
2. This file covers subtopic **D-4 — ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use** only. The main audit and sibling subtopic audits live alongside it in `research/audits/`.
3. Hand the file (and `research/raw/`) to the builder, or paste the whole document into an AI — every claim cites an evidence ID that maps to a cached primary source.
4. Re-run `node bin/audit.mjs` after further research to bump versions and capture what changed.

## Provenance

- Preflight: PASS (`node bin/preflight.mjs` returns 0)
- Scope: subtopic D-4 (ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use)
- Evidence files: 1 page from `research/raw/`
- Ledger entries: 7 (chain verified)
- Failures recorded in this scope: 0
- Source of truth: research/DISCOVERY.md, research/EVIDENCE.md, research/MAP.md, research/raw/
- Regenerate: `node bin/audit.mjs` (bumps patch versions for any scope whose fingerprint changed)
