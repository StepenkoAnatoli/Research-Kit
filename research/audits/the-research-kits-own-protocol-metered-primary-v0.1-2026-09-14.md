# The research kit's own protocol: metered primary-source collection, provenance, and gate — Research Audit v0.1

_Generated 2026-09-14. Evidence window: 2026-09-13. Version 0.1._

## Executive Summary

This audit compiles 4 verified findings about **The research kit's own protocol: metered primary-source collection, provenance, and gate** from 6 primary-source pages cached under `research/raw/`. Every relevant blocking unknown has primary-source evidence; none remain open. Top finding: Free plan: 10 /scrape and 10 /search requests per minute, 2 concurrent browsers, 50,000 max queued jobs..

## What this project is

A research-first kit for this machine: a collector that turns a Firecrawl fetch into
cached, citable evidence, and a gate that refuses to let a build start while a blocking
fact is unproven. "Done" means an agent asked to build something can no longer answer
*insufficient information* and stop — it either produces primary-source evidence, or
names the one fact it could not reach and records the day-one step that would settle it.

The reason this file exists at all: this repository is the kit's own development home, so
it inherits its own gate. A gate that exempts the project it ships with is a gate nobody
should trust, so this contract is real rather than waived.

## How to use this file

Paste this entire document (or the relevant per-subtopic file) into an AI, or hand it to a human reader. Every claim cites an `E-##` evidence ID; the full cached page lives at `research/raw/<file>` referenced from `research/EVIDENCE.md`. Sections marked **TODO** require human judgement; everything else is assembled from primary-source evidence. Per-subtopic audits sit alongside this file in `research/audits/` with filenames of the form `<main>--<sub>-v0.<n>-<date>.md`.

## Topic map

| ID | Subtopic | Status | Covered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Access model | COVERED | U-1 |
| D-2 | Auth and credentials | COVERED | U-1 |
| D-3 | Rate limits and quotas | COVERED | U-1 |
| D-4 | ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use | COVERED | U-4 |
| D-5 | Data schema and its stability | DISMISSED | captures are frozen point-in-time and hash-chained; source drift is handled by retrieval dates, the staleness fail, and --refresh-days - there is no extraction layer whose schema could break |
| D-6 | Freshness and staleness | DISMISSED | handled structurally, not researched: every claim carries a retrieval date, preflight fails stale evidence past maxAgeDays, and volatile facts are re-collected with --refresh-days |
| D-7 | Cost at expected volume | COVERED | U-1 |
| D-8 | Runtime and platform limits | COVERED | U-2, U-3 |
| D-9 | Output obtainability | COVERED | U-1 |
| S-2 | Which skill root the desktop runtime discovers, and how the protocol binds in Cowork | COVERED | U-2 |
| S-3 | Whether the edit-time PreToolUse gate blocks (allow/deny/ask/defer, exit-2 semantics) | COVERED | U-3 |
| S-4 | Collection provenance: which transport fetched a capture, and how much of the page arrived | DISMISSED | out of scope as an *unknown*: it is now a machine-checked property (transport field + completeness grades + the two contract checks), not a question to research |
| S-5 | Paid-tier Firecrawl pricing beyond the free plan (Hobby/Standard/Growth/Scale) | DISMISSED | out of scope for now: solo operator on the free tier; the tier facts are already captured and cited (E-01..E-03), and refresh stays with --refresh-days |

## Decision

**TODO** — fill in the Decision section of `research/BRIEF.md` (what to build first and what is explicitly out of scope) and re-run `node bin/audit.mjs` to refresh the audit.

## Next steps

1. Review **Contradictions** and **Decision** in `research/BRIEF.md`; if they are TODO, no builder should start yet.
2. Per-subtopic audits live alongside this file in `research/audits/` (filenames contain `--<subslug>`) and can be pasted independently.
3. Hand the file (and `research/raw/`) to the builder, or paste the whole document into an AI — every claim cites an evidence ID that maps to a cached primary source.
4. Re-run `node bin/audit.mjs` after further research to bump versions and capture what changed.

## Provenance

- Preflight: PASS (`node bin/preflight.mjs` returns 0)
- Scope: full corpus
- Evidence files: 6 pages from `research/raw/`
- Ledger entries: 7 (chain verified)
- Failures recorded in this scope: 0
- Source of truth: research/DISCOVERY.md, research/EVIDENCE.md, research/MAP.md, research/raw/
- Regenerate: `node bin/audit.mjs` (bumps patch versions for any scope whose fingerprint changed)
