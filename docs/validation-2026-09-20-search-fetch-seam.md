# Validation — search/fetch seam

- **Date:** 2026-09-20
- **Requirements:** `docs/requirements-2026-09-19-search-fetch-seam.md`
- **Decision:** `docs/adr/0027-search-and-fetch-are-two-seams.md`
- **Commits:** `5ff0bdd` (spec) → `a536ec1` (build) → `8111c66` (tests) → this one
- **Suite:** 472 passed, 0 failed
- **Status:** every gap named in this document is **closed** (2026-09-20), including the live collecting run, which is now an opt-in test and has been executed.

Every requirement is below. A requirement is only **VERIFIED** if something fails when it
stops being true. Anything else says what it actually is.

## Functional

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Two providers resolved independently | VERIFIED | `serpapi.test.mjs` — "the two sides are chosen INDEPENDENTLY", "with a key, the search side moves to its own meter" |
| FR-2 | A search provider implements `search` and nothing else | VERIFIED | "the two shapes are declared", "asked to fetch, it refuses BY NAME" |
| FR-3 | Fetch contract unchanged | VERIFIED | `transport.test.mjs`'s existing seven-function test still passes untouched; `satisfies(firecrawl, FETCH_SHAPE)` |
| FR-4 | `lib/serpapi.mjs` implements it against SerpAPI | VERIFIED | 49 tests, replaying a real captured response |
| FR-5 | No key ⇒ behaviour identical to before | VERIFIED | `search-seam.test.mjs` TR-8 compares ledger entries field for field between an old-style and a new-style run |
| FR-6 | `--search-transport` plus env and config below it | VERIFIED | `cli.test.mjs` spawns the real binary: the flag is documented, an unknown provider exits 2 naming the ones that exist, and the flag is asserted to outrank an environment key |
| FR-7 | `doctor` reports the search provider on its own line | VERIFIED | `cli.test.mjs` spawns `doctor.mjs` with and without a key and asserts both the line and that the key is never printed |
| FR-8 | `--status` and `--dry-run` name both providers before spending | VERIFIED | Six `cli.test.mjs` tests, including that a dry run writes nothing to the usage log and that a one-provider run does not announce two |
| FR-9 | A result carries which provider produced it, through to promotion | VERIFIED | `search-seam.test.mjs` — three DR-2 tests |

## Non-functional

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | Zero new runtime dependencies | VERIFIED | Test parses `serpapi.mjs`'s own import statements and fails on anything not `node:` or relative |
| NFR-2 | `selectTransport`'s old shape unchanged | VERIFIED | "selectTransport still answers the OLD question the old way", and 348 pre-existing tests passing untouched |
| NFR-3 | No vendor name outside an adapter and the registry | VERIFIED | Test walks every `lib/*.mjs`, strips comments, and allows exactly one exception — `machine.mjs`, which owns the config schema |
| NFR-4 | Every network path injectable | VERIFIED | The entire 49-test adapter suite runs with no key, no network and no credits |

## Constraints

Constraints are facts read off captured pages, not behaviours. They are verified by the
research gate, not by the test suite: each traces to an `E-##` row that resolves to a
cached page, and `preflight` refuses a claim whose capture is missing.

| ID | Fact | Source |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | 250 searches/month, 50/hour on the free tier | E-07 |
| C-2 | Billed per response, not per result | E-07 |
| C-3 | Free 1-hour server-side cache; `no_cache` defaults false | E-09 |
| C-4 | Legal Shield excluded on Free/Starter/Developer | E-10 |
| C-5 | Retention unprohibited, not granted | E-10, E-16 |
| C-6 | Tavily excluded — trains on inputs and outputs | E-16 |
| C-7 | Firecrawl allows 10 `/search` per minute | E-01 |

C-2 and C-3 are also *relied on in code* and that reliance is pinned: the request sends
no count parameter and never sends `no_cache` (IR tests below).

## Architecture

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | One reader for provider choice | VERIFIED | Test scans `lib/` and `bin/` for any module indexing `SEARCH_PROVIDERS` itself |
| AR-2 | Contracts declared, not implied | VERIFIED | `FETCH_SHAPE`/`SEARCH_SHAPE` asserted; both registries checked for cross-contamination |
| AR-3 | A search-only module refuses by name | VERIFIED | Three refusals asserted by error `code`, plus the test that `isSearchOnly` reads the declaration — which is the bug that actually happened |
| AR-4 | `transport-provenance` untouched | VERIFIED | `git diff` over `lib/checks.mjs` across this whole change is empty; plus "a capture is stamped with what FETCHED it" |

## Data

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| DR-1 | Usage log records both meters | VERIFIED | Two tests, including one that a search-only run is still recorded |
| DR-2 | A promoted URL records its ranker | VERIFIED | Four tests across both callers; absence asserted for planned URLs |
| DR-3 | *(amended)* No search in the hash chain; one optional fetch field | VERIFIED | "a search is never a ledger entry", "entries WITHOUT discoveredBy hash as they always did" |
| DR-4 | Failure log attributes the provider | VERIFIED | `search-seam.test.mjs` DR-4 |
| DR-5 | Record reported cost; where none is reported, say so | VERIFIED | Test asserts the payload has **no** cost field, so the rule-based count is justified rather than assumed |
| DR-6 | Record `search_metadata.id` | VERIFIED | `searchId` tested against the real fixture and two empty cases |

## Integration

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| IR-1 | Exactly `engine`, `q`, `api_key` at `/search` | VERIFIED | `requestUrl` extracted from the child specifically to make this testable; key set asserted exactly |
| IR-2 | `no_cache` never sent | VERIFIED | Negative assertion over seven forbidden parameters |
| IR-3 | `async` never sent | VERIFIED | Same test |
| IR-4 | No result-count parameter; slice locally | VERIFIED | Same test, plus the job-shape assertion and two limit tests |
| IR-5 | Read `organic_results`, map to the kit shape | VERIFIED | Field-by-field against the real payload |
| IR-6 | Failures logged and skipped, never thrown | VERIFIED | Eleven error shapes, all returning |

Two further attacks on IR-1 that the requirement did not ask for: a query containing
reserved characters round-trips rather than splitting the query string, and a query
crafted as `x&api_key=stolen&engine=evil` cannot inject or duplicate a parameter.

## Security

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SR-1 | Key from env or config, never the repo | VERIFIED | `readKey` precedence tested; plus a literal grep of the working tree for the real key, clean |
| SR-2 | Never rendered in any human-facing output | VERIFIED | `cmd` asserted redacted; **and the defect found here** — a query containing the key is now refused before transmission |
| SR-3 | Scrubbed from vendor error text | VERIFIED | Four tests: transport error, error payload, `command()` directly, and a sweep asserting no field of any result carries it |
| SR-4 | Secret scan passes with no new exclusion | VERIFIED | `doctor`: 194 files, 8 patterns, no exclusion added. The sentinel is assembled at runtime |
| SR-5 | Disclose the retention honestly | VERIFIED | Documented in the requirements, ADR-0027 and `status()`'s own text; test asserts `searchesRemaining` is `null` rather than a guess |

The fixture carried a second credential-shaped thing nobody specified: account-scoped
capability URLs that read the stored search back. Swept and asserted absent.

## Reliability

| ID | What it required | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| RR-1 | Degrade to the fetch provider, once, recorded | VERIFIED | Four tests across both callers, including both-providers-down |
| RR-2 | Bounded and reported | VERIFIED | Call counts asserted; the words "spends fetch credits" asserted in the log |
| RR-3 | An exhausted cap is normal, not a crash | VERIFIED | The vendor's real exhaustion string, returned not thrown |
| RR-4 | A request carries a timeout | VERIFIED | Was listed as unverified after Phase C; now pinned — the timeout reaches `spawnSync` *and* the child, so a hung socket cannot outlive the corpus lock |
| RR-5 | *(amended)* Throttle → **report**, do not block | VERIFIED | Four tests. See the amendment below |

### RR-5 was changed, not met

The requirement asked for a throttle keeping the kit under 50 requests an hour. I did not
build one, and the reason is not effort.

A throttle would be this kit refusing work based on a counter it cannot actually see —
it knows only its own machine's runs, and it cannot tell a repeat served from the
vendor's free 1-hour cache (which costs nothing) from a fresh search (which does). It
would therefore block on a number that is wrong in the direction of blocking. Meanwhile
the vendor already answers a throttled request with an error, and RR-3 handles that by
degrading. A guard that duplicates the vendor's own answer can only add a way to be
wrong.

What was genuinely missing was the operator being able to *see* the meter. So
`searchUsage()` counts and `research --status` reports:

```
searches (this box) 0 in the last hour, 1 this month (serpapi)
                   free-tier caps are 50/hour and 250/month; counted from this
                   machine's own runs; a repeat served from the provider's free
                   cache is counted here but not billed
```

The caveat ships in the data structure, not just the display, and a test asserts it
admits both limits.

## Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | New tests pass, the existing 348 still pass | **MET** — 472 passed, 0 failed (348 before this change, so 124 new) |
| AC-2 | No key ⇒ one provider, dry run unchanged | **MET** — TR-8 plus live `--status` |
| AC-3 | With a key ⇒ two providers, confirmed against both meters | **MET** — live run: 1 SerpAPI search, Firecrawl 919→917 |
| AC-4 | `preflight` PASSes and the chain verifies after a two-provider run | **MET** — PASS, 20 entries, chain verifies |
| AC-5 | Secret scan passes with no new exclusion | **MET** |
| AC-6 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated in the same commit | **MET** — enforced by the gate, which blocked twice until it was |
| AC-7 | Every requirement maps to a test or an explicit gap | **MET** — this document |

## The three gaps — closed 2026-09-20

All three were closed after this document first shipped. Each is recorded with what the
closing found, because two of the three turned up something the argument had missed.

**1. The CLI layer had no automated test. — CLOSED, and it was hiding a defect.**

`test/cli.test.mjs` spawns the real binaries and reads their real stdout: 20 tests over
`research.mjs`, `decompose.mjs`, `doctor.mjs` and `bundle.mjs`. Nothing spends a credit —
every invocation is `--help`, `--status` or `--dry-run`.

The first test that ever ran `research.mjs --status` with a bad flag found this:

```
$ research --status --transport firecrwal
transport          unresolved
search transport   unresolved
$ echo $?
0
```

`--status` caught the `UNKNOWN_TRANSPORT` error and dropped it. The catch block's comment
said `/* reported below */` and nothing below reported it — so a typo'd provider name
printed as *"unresolved"* and exited **0**, which reads as a healthy machine with a
detection problem rather than as a misspelled flag. The non-status path had always exited
2 correctly; only the informational one swallowed it. Fixed: the error is printed and the
exit is 2, and the now-unreachable `'unresolved'` branches are gone.

This is precisely the gap's own argument coming true. The wiring was "checked by hand" —
by me, running the commands that worked.

**2. Two-provider concurrency was an argument. — CLOSED, argument confirmed.**

Five tests in `search-seam.test.mjs`. The claim was "a search takes no lock because it
writes nothing"; both halves are now checked rather than asserted. A search runs to
completion *inside* a held `withLock` block and does not disturb it; a byte-for-byte
snapshot of `research/` is unchanged across a search on the success path, the failure
path and the no-key path; and two separate **processes** collect concurrently with
*different* search providers, after which the chain still verifies, both entries survive,
and each names the provider that ranked its own URL.

**3. The live path was exercised, not pinned. — CLOSED.**

`test/serpapi-live.test.mjs`: 13 tests where every request travels parent → `spawnSync` →
child process → global `fetch` → a real socket → an HTTP server standing in for the
vendor. No network, no key, no credits, repeatable. It pins the 401, the exhausted
allowance, a 500, an HTML error page, truncated JSON, a connection killed mid-flight, an
unanswering server against the timeout, and — the assertion no injected stub could make —
*what the child actually put on the wire*: exactly `engine`, `q`, `api_key`, and none of
the six forbidden parameters.

Two things that made it possible, and one that nearly stopped it:

- `search({ endpoint })` is new, and **guarded**. `allowedEndpoint` permits the vendor's
  own host over https, or loopback. An overridable endpoint on a request carrying an API
  key is otherwise an exfiltration route, so both halves check it — the parent before
  spawning, the child before fetching, because the child reads its job off a pipe and
  does not get to trust it.
- The first version hosted the server in the test process and **every request timed out**.
  The cause is the reason this module exists: the adapter shape is synchronous, so the
  parent reaches the vendor through `spawnSync`, which blocks its own event loop. A server
  in that loop can never accept the connection. Parent waits for child, child waits for
  server, server waits for parent. The stand-in now runs in its own process.

### The last inch — closed 2026-09-20

The fourth limit, recorded here briefly and then closed, because the reason given for it
was sloppy. It said a live collecting run "costs money to assert". That conflated two
different things:

- Running it **once** costs a couple of credits. That was never blocked.
- Running it on **every `selftest.mjs`** costs a couple of credits every time, for every
  developer, forever. That is the actual constraint, and it is a reason to make the test
  opt-in — not a reason for it not to exist.

`test/live-collect.test.mjs` drives `bin/research.mjs` through a real collecting run
against both real providers. It is gated on `RESEARCH_KIT_LIVE=1` **and** a key being
present; with the gate shut it registers one test that asserts the gate is shut, for the
right reasons, including that a truthy-looking value like `yes` does not open it. So the
file is never dead code and the opt-in mechanism is itself covered.

```bash
RESEARCH_KIT_LIVE=1 SERPAPI_API_KEY=... node research-kit/bin/selftest.mjs
```

It scaffolds a temp project, so a live run never touches this repository's corpus — and a
second test asserts exactly that, because a live test quietly collecting into the real
corpus would put unreviewed captures behind the gate.

**Run for real on 2026-09-20. Both tests passed.** What it measured:

| | |
|---|---|
| Firecrawl credits | **917 → 916** — one credit, for one page |
| SerpAPI | 1 search, on its own meter |
| Ledger entry | `transport: firecrawl-cli`, `discoveredBy: serpapi` |
| Usage log | `searchTransport: serpapi`, `searchesUsed: 1`, `degraded: 0` |
| This repository | untouched; chain still verifies at 20 entries |

That single number is the thesis of ADR-0027, measured end to end through the shipped
binary rather than argued. **Before the split the same run cost three Firecrawl credits**
— two for the search, one for the page. It now costs one, because the search is not on
that budget any more.

The assertion is written as a range (`>= 1` and `<= 3` credits) rather than an exact
figure, so it survives a vendor changing a price but still fails if the search ever comes
back onto the fetch meter.

## Requirements that changed during the work

Recorded because a specification quietly edited to match the build is not a
specification.

| ID | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| IR-1/IR-4 | `num` removed before any code | Not in the captured reference. Third assumed-parameter defect in this project |
| DR-5 | "Record reported cost" → "and where none is reported, say so" | `search_metadata` carries no cost field |
| SR-5 | ZeroTrace described as paid → **Enterprise only** | The API reference is narrower than the pricing table |
| DR-3 | "Ledger unchanged" → "no search ENTRY; one optional field" | DR-2 needed somewhere durable |
| RR-5 | Throttle → report | A guard on a number the kit cannot see correctly |

## Defects found and fixed

| # | Found by | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase B smoke test | `isSearchOnly` duck-typed "has no scrape", so it answered `false` for the only search-only module | Read the declared `CONTRACTS` |
| 2 | Phase B corpus inspection | DR-2 specified, never implemented — `rankedBy` reached nothing durable | Ledger `discoveredBy` |
| 3 | Phase C security test | A query containing the API key was transmitted **and written into the committed ledger** | Refuse before transmitting; redact `command()` anyway |
| 4 | Phase C integration test | Defect 2's fix applied to one of two call sites | Both callers; checked for a third |

Defects 2 and 4 are the same mistake twice — fixing where the symptom appeared rather
than everywhere the cause lives. That pattern is now in the commit record deliberately.
