# MAP - topic decomposition

## Topic

Which licence should Research-Kit publish under so that people and agents may install and run it, and may the cached third-party pages in its research corpora be redistributed under it

## Subtopics

Statuses are blank on purpose: phase 0 gathers material, it does not judge. Mark each
row COVERED (cite the U-## rows that cover it), DISMISSED (reason required - dismissing
is fine, omitting is not), or GAP, and add topic-specific subtopics where the checklist
is not enough.

| ID | Subtopic | Why it matters | Status | Covered by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Access model | Public pages, an official API, an auth-walled app, or a paywall - each is a different collection design | COVERED | U-01, U-07 |
| D-2 | Auth and credentials | What accounts, keys, or logins the collection and the product need, and who holds them | DISMISSED | a licence decision needs no account or key; nothing in it is collected behind a login |
| D-3 | Rate limits and quotas | Caps every cadence in the design, and caps the research collection itself | DISMISSED | no rate-limited source is part of the design; the collection is a few public pages fetched once |
| D-4 | ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use | A prohibition on automated collection, storage, or display ends the design for that source - and sometimes the project | COVERED | U-01, U-02, U-03, U-04, U-05, U-06 |
| D-5 | Data schema and its stability | How the data is shaped, and how often the source changes the shape without asking | DISMISSED | no data schema is consumed; the artefacts are licence texts and terms pages read once |
| D-6 | Freshness and staleness | How fast the data goes stale, and what staleness costs the product that depends on it | COVERED | U-03 |
| D-7 | Cost at expected volume | The economics at real usage, not the pricing page's first row - this decides viability | DISMISSED | a licence costs nothing to run; the commercial terms it sets are U-03, not a running cost |
| D-8 | Runtime and platform limits | Where this actually executes - OS, runtime version, desktop app, cloud - and what those limits forbid | DISMISSED | a licence file runs nowhere; GitHub's recognition of it is U-07, a detection rule, not a platform limit |
| D-9 | Output obtainability | Does the data your stated "done" depends on exist, and can you actually get it? Load-bearing: a project whose output cannot be produced should die in phase 1, not phase 2 | COVERED | U-07 |
| D-10 | Rights in the cached third-party pages | A repository licence covers the author's own work; the captures under research/raw are other people's pages, and redistributing them is governed by their licences and by copyright law, not by LICENSE | COVERED | U-04, U-05 |
| D-11 | Precedent in archival and evidence tools | Web archives and crawl corpora redistribute whole captured pages every day; the terms they publish are the nearest practice to what this kit does | COVERED | U-06 |

## Coverage notes (per dimension)

- D-1, D-9: U-01 says what a public repository with no licence actually grants (GitHub's
  terms, and the no-permission reading); U-07 says whether a per-path licence split can be
  expressed and is recognised, which is the output this decision has to produce.
- D-4: the heart of the question. U-02 and U-03 are the candidate licences for the code;
  U-04, U-05 and U-06 are whether the captures may travel with it.
- D-6: U-03 - a source-available licence with a change date turns into an open licence on
  a schedule, which is a freshness property of the licence itself.
- D-10, D-11: added for the second half of the topic; the universal checklist has no row
  for "rights in material the project redistributes", and this project is that case.
- D-2, D-3, D-5, D-7, D-8: dismissed with the reason in the row.
- Phase 0 is on the record as a lesson: every search for "Research-Kit" found Apple's
  ResearchKit, and the three pages gathered are about Google's cached-page operator. The
  relevance floor skipped the former; the latter were scraped and carry nothing. The plan
  below names the owner pages by hand.

## Outlines seen in the material

The section headings of the gathered pages that are captured - what related material
covers, as its own tables of contents say (STORM's perspective step, without the model).
Not a verdict: a heading worth a subtopic becomes a row by your hand.
