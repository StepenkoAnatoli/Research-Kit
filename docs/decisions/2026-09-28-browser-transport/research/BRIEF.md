# Brief - Headless Chromium as a free transport: dump-dom rendering, proxy settings, sandbox and timeouts

_Auto-drafted 2026-09-28 by `bin/brief.mjs` from the corpus. Sections marked **TODO**
require human/agent judgement; everything else is assembled from evidence already
in `research/`. While a **TODO** remains, this brief is **not reviewed** and the
handoff is **not approved** - a structurally valid corpus, a reviewed one, and an
approved handoff are three different states._

Reviewed by: agent

**This is the phase-1 to phase-2 handoff.** **Gate: PASS.** Every blocking unknown is closed with evidence, and every claim below
traces to a cached page in `research/raw/`.

Whoever you are - another agent, a different model, or a person - read this file
first. You should not need to re-research anything to start work. If something
here is not enough to build from, say which fact is missing rather than guessing
it: that is a phase-1 gap to close, not a phase-2 judgment call.

## The prior, registered before anything was collected

_Ledger seq 1, chained: neither this text nor its place before the evidence
can be changed now. Read it against the findings below - it may well be wrong, and a wrong
prior that was recorded in advance is worth more than a right one remembered afterwards._

> I expect headless Chromium's --dump-dom to print the rendered DOM after load, with --virtual-time-budget to let scripts settle; Chromium on Linux to honour proxy environment variables only without a desktop environment, so --proxy-server is the safe route; and --no-sandbox to be needed when running as root.

## Intent

A free transport that renders pages with a locally installed Chromium, for pages the
keyless transport cannot read (JavaScript-built pages, sites that refuse non-browser
clients) and as a better credits-exhausted fallback. The kit has no dependencies, so it
must drive Chromium from the command line, not through a driver library. Done means the
command, the proxy route, the sandbox constraint and the failure modes are known.

## What we verified

| Claim | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome headless docs: headless mode is the `--headless` flag on a normal Chrome binary; since Chrome 132 the old headless mode ships only as a separate `chrome-headless-shell` binary. [quote: To use Headless mode, pass the `--headless` command-line flag to a Chrome binary] | E-01 `developer.chrome.com` (U-01) | P |
| Chromium network settings: a custom proxy is set with `--proxy-server=<uri>[:<port>]`, which takes precedence over proxy auto-detection. [quote: This tells Chrome to use a custom proxy configuration] | E-03 `chromium.org` (U-02) | P |

## Contradictions and how they were resolved

No source disagrees. What the documents do not say, and a run in this environment showed on
2026-09-28, shapes the design more than any of them. These are observations, not captured
evidence:

- **`--dump-dom` exits 0 on failure.** Behind a TLS-intercepting proxy whose CA Chromium did
  not trust, it printed Chromium's own "Privacy error" page (`ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`,
  131,208 bytes, identical for two different URLs) and exited 0. A transport that trusted
  the exit code would file Chromium's error page as evidence. This is the same class as the
  503 page fixed in 13ff0ea.
- **With the environment's CAs trusted, it works.** The CAs were added to Chromium's NSS
  store with `certutil`, the way the environment provides them; TLS was not weakened.
  - nodejs.org rendered its fs documentation page (1.16 MB).
  - GitHub Discussion 188488 rendered in full (1.38 MB, 45 mentions of "training").
  - For that same Discussion, the kit's keyless transport got **HTTP 403**. GitHub refuses
    the non-browser client.

## Known unknowns

- **U-03** - When must the sandbox be turned off?
  - Day-one verification: The owning Chromium page answered 503 (E-04). ArchiveBox passes `--no-sandbox` in containers (E-05, secondary). Day one: pass `--no-sandbox` only when running as root, and confirm on the first non-root Windows run that Chromium starts without it.

## Decision

**Build `browser`, a fetch-only transport that runs a local Chromium from the command line.**

- **Command:** `<chrome> --headless --disable-gpu --virtual-time-budget=<ms> --dump-dom <url>`,
  spawned as an argv array with no shell, like the Firecrawl CLI.
  - `--proxy-server=<HTTPS_PROXY>` when a proxy is configured (E-03).
  - `--no-sandbox` only when running as root (U-03, known unknown).
- **Converting the page:** the dumped HTML goes through the keyless transport's existing
  HTML-to-text extractor, so both transports grade captures with the same rules.
- **Failure detection:**
  - A non-zero exit or a timeout is a failure.
  - So is a page that is Chromium's own error page: a `<title>` of "Privacy error", or
    body text carrying a Chromium `ERR_` network error code, the kind that produced the
    identical 131,208-byte page for two URLs. A failure names the code.
- **Finding the browser:** `browserPath` in the machine config, then
  `RESEARCH_KIT_BROWSER`, then the usual install locations for the platform. Absent means
  the transport says so and is not selected.
- **Scope:** fetch only, no search. Search stays with the selected search provider.
- **Credits-exhausted fallback:** the fallback (ADR-0086) prefers `browser` when a
  browser is found, else `http-keyless`.

**Out of scope:** a driver library (the kit stays dependency-free); screenshots and PDFs;
`--ignore-certificate-errors`, ever.

**First build step:** `lib/browser-transport.mjs` with an injectable spawn. Test it against
stub output for a normal page, the recorded "Privacy error" page, a timeout and a missing
binary. Then do one real run here, and one comparison with keyless on the Discussion page.

## Next steps

1. Build the transport above, with its ADR, in the same commit.
2. Hand this file to the builder (phase 2). Re-running `node "$HOME/.agents/research-kit/bin/brief.mjs"`
   redrafts this file while it is unedited; after any edit it refuses without `--force`,
   so your judgements are preserved.
