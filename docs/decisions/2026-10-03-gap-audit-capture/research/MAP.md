# MAP - topic decomposition

## Topic

What do web-capture, annotation and HTTP standards require of a faithful, re-anchorable and current capture, as a benchmark for Research-Kit's captures

## Subtopics

Statuses are blank on purpose: phase 0 gathers material, it does not judge. Mark each
row COVERED (cite the U-## rows that cover it), DISMISSED (reason required - dismissing
is fine, omitting is not), or GAP, and add topic-specific subtopics where the checklist
is not enough.

| ID | Subtopic | Why it matters | Status | Covered by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Access model | Public pages, an official API, an auth-walled app, or a paywall - each is a different collection design | COVERED | U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, U-5 |
| D-2 | Auth and credentials | What accounts, keys, or logins the collection and the product need, and who holds them | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-3 | Rate limits and quotas | Caps every cadence in the design, and caps the research collection itself | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-4 | ToS, licensing, legality of the intended use | A prohibition on automated collection, storage, or display ends the design for that source - and sometimes the project | COVERED | U-5 |
| D-5 | Data schema and its stability | How the data is shaped, and how often the source changes the shape without asking | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-6 | Freshness and staleness | How fast the data goes stale, and what staleness costs the product that depends on it | COVERED | U-4 |
| D-7 | Cost at expected volume | The economics at real usage, not the pricing page's first row - this decides viability | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-8 | Runtime and platform limits | Where this actually executes - OS, runtime version, desktop app, cloud - and what those limits forbid | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-9 | Output obtainability | Does the data your stated "done" depends on exist, and can you actually get it? Load-bearing: a project whose output cannot be produced should die in phase 1, not phase 2 | DISMISSED | a standards benchmark reads public specifications |
| D-10 | Re-anchoring a quotation after the page changes | The kit's quote anchor is an exact substring test against one capture; the annotation standards carry context and tolerate edits, and whether the kit's anchor survives a changed page is a fidelity property of the evidence | COVERED | U-1 |
| D-11 | Character-encoding determination | A capture decoded under the wrong encoding is a faithful copy of the wrong text; the standards fix the order of BOM, header, meta and default | COVERED | U-2 |
| D-12 | What an archival capture records per response | WARC and WACZ fix the record set (request, response, capture instant, payload digest, package digest) that the kit's ledger is measured against | COVERED | U-3 |
| D-13 | Currency: revalidation instead of a day count | HTTP's validators and conditional requests say whether a page changed; the kit's refresh rule is a day count | COVERED | U-4 |
| D-14 | Crawl rules the publisher states | RFC 9309 and the vendor's statement decide whether a capture taken without consulting robots.txt is a gap | COVERED | U-5 |

## Coverage notes (per dimension)

- D-1: the owner pages are public specifications and the vendors' own documentation;
  every unknown reads one, so the access model is the same for all five.
- D-4: U-5 - the one legality question a capture carries is the publisher's crawl rules,
  RFC 9309, and whether the transport the kit pays for consults them.
- D-6: U-4 - staleness is HTTP's currency model: validators, conditional requests, 304.
- D-2, D-3, D-5, D-7, D-8, D-9: dismissed, with the reason in the row - a standards
  benchmark reads public specifications; nothing is collected behind an account, metered,
  schema-bound, priced, platform-limited or unobtainable.
- D-10 to D-14: added for the topic; each is one of the five standards and maps to one
  unknown.
- Phase 0 is on the record: the compound topic was split into four fragments (ADR-0085),
  of which "What do web-capture" found Microsoft Edge screenshot pages and "as a benchmark
  for Research-Kit's captures" found exome capture kits; the two pages collected are the
  W3C annotation model (Recommendation, keyless, graded partial) and its 2014 first public
  working draft. The plan names the owner pages by hand.

Skipped on the likely owner - the relevance floor passed these over, because a terse
title and an off-topic page look the same to it. If one is the page that owns the fact,
name it in `research/plan.json` `urls` (ADR-0097):

## Outlines seen in the material

The section headings of the gathered pages that are captured - what related material
covers, as its own tables of contents say (STORM's perspective step, without the model).
Not a verdict: a heading worth a subtopic becomes a row by your hand.
