# Evidence

One row per fetched page. `Raw` points at the cached page text under `research/raw/`,
which is what makes the claim checkable - a row without raw evidence fails preflight.

The `Finding` cell arrives as an auto-extracted summary. Rewrite it into a real claim:
what the page actually establishes, with the quote or number that proves it.

| E-01 | 2026-09-28 | P | https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.1/ | WARC 1.1: a record is a "WARC/1.1" version line, named fields, CRLF, the block, CRLF CRLF; WARC-Record-ID, Content-Length, WARC-Date and WARC-Type are mandatory. A resource record holds content "without full protocol response information"; a metadata record describes another record; compressing each record as its own GZIP member is recommended.
