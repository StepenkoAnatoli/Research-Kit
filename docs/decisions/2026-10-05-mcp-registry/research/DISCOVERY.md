# Discovery Contract - How should Research-Kit be distributed and listed in the official MCP Registry?

Started 2026-10-05. This file is the definition of "enough information to build".
`node "$HOME/.agents/research-kit/bin/preflight.mjs"` reads it and blocks the build until every unknown
below is either `CLOSED` with evidence or `KNOWN-UNKNOWN` with a verification step.

## Build intent

Determine a supported way to list Research-Kit's existing stdio MCP server in the
official MCP Registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io), so developers using Claude
Code, Cursor and VS Code can find it. The research deliverable is an evidence-backed
decision and builder handoff covering distribution, Registry publication and client
discoverability, including the server's GitHub-token requirement. This task completes
phase-1 research. It does not publish a package or Registry entry, change the MCP server,
or authorize a packaging design. Expected volume is one manually reviewed initial
listing, not an aggregator or scheduled publication system.

Starting assumptions supplied by the operator, not collected evidence: the Registry
requires a server.json pointing to a published package; Research-Kit is not published;
`npm view research-kit` returned 404 on 2026-10-05. Verify these against primary sources
during research rather than treating them as closed unknowns or choosing npm upfront.

## Unknowns

A fact belongs here when guessing it wrong changes the design: API limits and pricing,
auth model, data schemas, rate limits, licensing/ToS, platform behavior, current library
versions, competitor pricing, data availability.

Status is exactly one of:
- `CLOSED` - proven by an `E-##` row in `research/EVIDENCE.md` (which must point at cached raw text).
- `KNOWN-UNKNOWN` - unreachable now; the `Evidence` cell names the day-one verification step.

Anything else (`OPEN`, blank, "in progress") fails the gate.

| ID | Unknown | Why it blocks the build | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U-01 | What does the Registry host, and must an installation route be public? (D-1, D-9) | A GitHub checkout may not supply a supported installation route. | CLOSED | E-01 |
| U-02 | Which distributions describe the existing local stdio server, and how is package ownership proved? (D-9, D-10) | npm is a candidate, not an assumed requirement. | CLOSED | E-02, E-03, E-06 |
| U-03 | What metadata describes stdio execution and secret configuration? (D-5, D-8) | A listing must launch the intended program without embedding credentials. | CLOSED | E-03, E-05, E-06 |
| U-04 | What publisher accounts and namespace authentication are required? (D-2) | Repository access and the runtime token are different from namespace ownership. | CLOSED | E-04, E-06 |
| U-05 | What preview, version and lifecycle behavior affects freshness and rollback? (D-5, D-6) | Metadata may be immutable or a schema may change. | CLOSED | E-01, E-07 |
| U-06 | How do Claude Code, Cursor and VS Code install and discover MCP servers? (D-8, D-11) | Official listing cannot promise automatic installation in all clients. | CLOSED | E-08, E-09, E-10, E-11, E-18 |
| U-07 | What npm public cost, account and publishing requirements apply? (D-2, D-7) | A recommended candidate needs explicit public visibility and publisher access. | CLOSED | E-12, E-13, E-19 |
| U-08 | What license and service conditions bound redistribution and metadata? (D-4) | Preserve the kit's notice and check host conditions. | CLOSED | E-14, E-17, E-19 |
| U-09 | Which runtime, token and version constraints must later packaging preserve? (D-2, D-8, D-10, D-12) | Distribution is separate from changing the existing frozen server. | CLOSED | E-15, E-16, E-20, E-21; local tracked-source inspection confirms ADR-0117 remains in force |
| U-10 | Can this operator publish the chosen package/namespace and gain desired catalog placement? (D-2, D-9, D-11) | Private account privileges and future catalog admission cannot be invented. | KNOWN-UNKNOWN | Private account privileges, final package-name ownership and future catalog admission were not exercised. Day-one: operator confirms npm identity/scope and 2FA, authenticates publisher for the intended namespace, verifies package-name availability, and after an approved publication checks the official API and each desired catalog. Use manual client configuration until actual admission is observed. E-04, E-11, E-12, E-18 supply public requirements, not this operator's result. |

## Questions for the human (maximum 3)

Intent questions only - things no document can answer. Facts never go here; they go in
the table above. If a question's answer is in public documentation, it is a research
task, not a question.

## Already decided

Locked decisions for this project. Do not revisit these without the human.

- Keep this decision's contract and eventual corpus in this nested project, separate
  from the repository's root transport/vendor research (ADR-0030).
- ADR-0116 rejected a package.json version field because the kit is not an npm package.
  It remains in force; this scaffold does not supersede it.
- The feature freeze in ADR-0117 remains in force. Any implementation that requires
  lifting it needs an explicit ADR for that item after research, not an implicit
  exception in this scaffold.
- Use the existing MCP server at `research-kit/bin/mcp-server.mjs` as the starting
  point; do not include credentials in committed research or package metadata.
