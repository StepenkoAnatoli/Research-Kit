# Research-first project bootstrap

Agent instructions for this project. Read this before planning, designing, or building
anything here.

## How this project works: two phases, two roles

**Phase 1 - research (this kit).** Close every blocking unknown with fetched primary
sources, then pass the gate. The output is a briefing, not code: `research/DISCOVERY.md`
(the contract), `research/EVIDENCE.md` (claims with cached pages behind them), and
`research/BRIEF.md` (the handoff). Phase 1 never writes product code.

**Phase 2 - build (someone else's job).** A builder - another agent, a different model, or
a human - takes `research/BRIEF.md` plus `research/` and implements. They should not need
to re-research anything: if they do, phase 1 was incomplete, and the fix is to collect the
missing fact rather than to let the builder guess it.

The gate is the handoff point. Before it passes, phase 2 does not start.

## Two machines, two roles

The role is machine config - `role: "collector" | "builder"` in
`~/.agents/research-kit.config.json`, default `collector`; declare it with
`node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/install-hooks.mjs --role builder`.

| | **collector** (the operator's PC) | **builder** (a sandbox, a CI box, a laptop) |
|---|---|---|
| holds | the Firecrawl key | no key, no Firecrawl egress |
| runs | `decompose.mjs`, `research.mjs` | `handoff.mjs`, `preflight.mjs`, the build |
| a missing key is | a **FAIL** | **informational** |
| must | push `research/raw/` including its dotfiles | **not collect** - the collection CLIs refuse (exit 2) |

**If you are on a builder machine and there is no brief: you do not collect.** A page
fetched by hand is not evidence in this kit, and a builder that "re-collects" a missing
page forges a corpus instead of reporting a gap. Name the missing fact instead.

A builder's first command is:

```
node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/handoff.mjs
```

The remedy depends on the cause, and the command says which: something that did not
travel is the collector's to push (`git add -f research/raw/`, dotfiles included);
a corpus that travelled whole and was rewritten on checkout here is fixed **here**, with
`.gitattributes`, and costs no credits.

## Starting in the wrong place: ask which project, do not hunt for it

The project is the **current working directory**. The kit takes no project argument and
never will. If the cwd is not the project the operator means - the kit's own repo, a
parent folder, an unrelated checkout - **ask which project**, and wait. Do not search the
filesystem, do not infer it from a name, do not look it up on a remote. Searching a
person's disk to guess his intent reads directories nobody authorised, and the question
it replaces takes one line.

Signals: no `AGENTS.md`, no `research/` directory, or a `research/` corpus plainly about
something else. An existing corpus about another topic is the signal doing its job.

## Resuming after an interruption: resume, do not restart

The gate is a pure function of repository state, so orient from disk before touching
anything. `doctor.mjs` and preflight answer *where this project is*; the last commit
report and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` say *what was happening and why*; `git status` answers
what is unfinished, and its uncommitted changes are the interrupted task - partial and
unverified, work in progress, never state to trust. The corpus is already collected and
spent credits are not spent again.

## Rule 1 - research first, then build

The sequence is decompose -> contract -> collect -> gate -> brief.

0. **Decompose** (collector machine): `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/decompose.mjs --topic "<topic>"`
   drafts `research/MAP.md` seeded with the universal checklist. The tool contains no
   judgment. Mark every row COVERED (citing U-## rows), DISMISSED (reason required), or
   GAP.
1. **Write the intent** in `research/DISCOVERY.md` under `## Build intent`, and enumerate
   the blocking unknowns FROM the map.
2. **Collect**: `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/research.mjs --plan research/plan.json`. Prefer the page
   that *owns* the fact over any write-up about it.
3. **Rewrite** each auto-extracted `Finding` cell into a real claim, keeping the `Raw`
   cell pointing at the cached page.
4. **Gate**: `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/preflight.mjs`. **Do not start building until it prints
   PASS.** Evidence must be *fetched*, not typed, and by a named transport.
5. **Hand off**: write `research/BRIEF.md`.

There are exactly three overrides - `git commit --no-verify`, a deliberate
`research/GATE_OFF`, and a repository-local `core.hooksPath` - and all three are recorded
in `research/overrides.log`. If you take one, say so in your reply.

## Rule 2 - questions are for intent, never for facts

At most **3** questions, once, up front, and only about things no document can answer. If
a question's answer is in public documentation, it is a research task. **Never answer
"insufficient info" and stop.**

## Rule 3 - known unknowns are allowed, silence is not

Mark a genuinely unreachable fact `KNOWN-UNKNOWN` and write the day-one verification step
in the `Evidence` cell. An unlabeled gap is the failure mode this project exists to
prevent.

## Rule 4 - source quality

`P` primary/official carries the design. `S` secondary is context. `L` lead-only is a
hint, never proof. Never invent a citation. Flag contradictions instead of averaging them.

## Rule 5 - cost discipline

Every scrape spends credits. Plan the queries in `research/plan.json` first, reuse the
cache (`--refresh-days`), and check the budget with `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/research.mjs --status`.

## Rule 6 - secrets

The key lives in the CLI config or the environment. Never write it into this repository.

## The standing protocol

Five rules for how work here is committed and recorded. Documentation, not enforcement:
no check judges prose, because a gate that judges prose is a gate that will be wrong.

1. **Architecture map current in the same commit.** A commit touching a declared code
   path (`research/kit.json`) stages `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with it. Enforced - and a
   prompt, not a proof: the gate checks the map was *staged*, not that it is *current*.
2. **Commit report: five named parts** - what changed / why / what it touched / what you
   verified / what you got wrong and fixed. The got-wrong line is not optional; if
   nothing was gotten wrong it is written as "nothing to report".
3. **An ADR for any choice with a rejected alternative**, dated, with the reason a future
   explorer would need to avoid re-suggesting it.
4. **One commit per task - the revert test.** `git revert <sha>` undoes it alone.
5. **A red suite stops work**, reported immediately and alone, **with the cwd recorded**.
