# REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions artifacts

Use the REST API to interact with artifacts in GitHub Actions.

## [About artifacts in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/artifacts?apiVersion=2026-03-10\#about-artifacts-in-github-actions)

You can use the REST API to download, delete, and retrieve information about workflow artifacts in GitHub Actions. Artifacts enable you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed. For more information, see [Store and share data with workflow artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/store-and-share-data).

## [List artifacts for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/artifacts?apiVersion=2026-03-10\#list-artifacts-for-a-repository)

Lists all artifacts for a repository.

Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.

### [Fine-grained access tokens for "List artifacts for a repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/artifacts?apiVersion=2026-03-10\#list-artifacts-for-a-repository--fine-grained-access-tokens)

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

- [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [GitHub App installation access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:

- "Actions" repository permissions (read)

This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.
