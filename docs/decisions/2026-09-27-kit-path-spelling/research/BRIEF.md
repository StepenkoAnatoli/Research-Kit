# Brief - PowerShell tilde expansion native commands HOME variable bash tilde expansion quoted cmd USERPROFILE

_Auto-drafted 2026-09-27 by `bin/brief.mjs` from the corpus. Sections marked **TODO**
require human/agent judgement; everything else is assembled from evidence already
in `research/`. While a **TODO** remains, this brief is **not reviewed** and the
handoff is **not approved** - a structurally valid corpus, a reviewed one, and an
approved handoff are three different states._

**This is the phase-1 to phase-2 handoff.** **Gate: PASS.** Every blocking unknown is closed with evidence, and every claim below
traces to a cached page in `research/raw/`.

Whoever you are - another agent, a different model, or a person - read this file
first. You should not need to re-research anything to start work. If something
here is not enough to build from, say which fact is missing rather than guessing
it: that is a phase-1 gap to close, not a phase-2 judgment call.

## The prior, registered before anything was collected

_Ledger seq 1, chained: neither this text nor its place before the evidence
can be changed now. Read it against the findings below - it may well be wrong, and a wrong
prior that was recorded in advance is worth more than a right one remembered afterwards._

> Expect: Windows PowerShell 5.1 passes ~ to a native command literally, so node ~/.agents/... fails there; PowerShell 7 expands an unquoted ~ for native commands on Windows only through the PSNativeWindowsTildeExpansion feature - experimental in 7.4, and perhaps mainstream by 7.5 or 7.6. Expect $HOME to be an automatic variable in every PowerShell, expanded inside double-quoted strings, including arguments to native commands. Expect bash to expand ~ only unquoted at the start of a word, and $HOME inside double quotes. Expect cmd.exe to use %NAME% syntax, with the home folder in %USERPROFILE%, and to expand neither ~ nor $HOME. So the likely answer is "$HOME/.agents/research-kit/bin/x.mjs" in double quotes for PowerShell, bash and zsh, plus a cmd line with %USERPROFILE%. Cannot know yet: which shell the operator actually uses - an intent question, not a document.

## Intent

Every project the kit scaffolds carries commands that run the kit, such as
`node {{KIT}}/bin/preflight.mjs` in AGENTS.md and START_HERE.md. `{{KIT}}` is rendered as this
machine's absolute kit path, or, for a project that travels, as a spelling passed with `--kit`.
The Actions collector passes `~/.agents/research-kit` (collect.yml), so every remote package
tells its reader to run `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/doctor.mjs`. The operator reads those
packages on Windows. Whether that command runs depends on the shell: whether it expands `~` for
a native command, whether it knows `$HOME`, and whether quoting (needed for a path with a
space) stops the expansion.

"Done" is:

1. the spelling a travelling project gets runs, as written, in the shells its readers use -
   Windows PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7, bash and zsh - and the documents say what cmd needs;
2. a kit path with a space does not split the command;
3. the decision rests on what each shell documents, not on how it behaved once.

## What we verified

| Claim | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|
| PSNativeWindowsTildeExpansion "was added in PowerShell 7.5-preview.2" and "became mainstream in PowerShell 7.6-preview.6"; the feature table marks it absent in 7.4, experimental in 7.5, mainstream in 7.6 and 7.7. Enabled, PowerShell "expands unquoted tilde (~) to the user's current home folder before invoking native commands"; "with the feature disabled, the tilde is passed to the native command as a literal string". Windows only. | E-01 `learn.microsoft.com` (U-1) | P |
| PowerShell (7.6 documentation): $HOME "contains the full path of the user's home directory"; on Windows it "uses the value of the $Env:USERPROFILE Windows environment variable, typically C:\Users\<UserName>", and on Unix the HOME environment variable. | E-04 `learn.microsoft.com` (U-2) | P |
| bash expands a tilde only when "a word begins with an unquoted tilde character"; a tilde-prefix with no login name "is replaced with the value of the HOME shell variable". A quoted ~ is not expanded. | E-06 `gnu.org` (U-3) | P |
| cmd references a variable by enclosing its name in percent signs - "you can use the string associated with BAUD as a replaceable parameter by typing %baud% at the command prompt". | E-08 `learn.microsoft.com` (U-4) | P |

## Contradictions and how they were resolved

**No source disagrees with another.** The PowerShell pages differ by version, and that is the
finding, not a contradiction. The tilde feature is absent through 7.4, experimental in 7.5 and
mainstream from 7.6 (E-01 to E-03). `$HOME` and expandable strings read the same in 5.1 (E-10,
E-11) as in 7.6 (E-04, E-05).

**The Windows pages were collected at two versions on purpose.** Microsoft Learn serves the latest
version by default. A claim about Windows PowerShell 5.1, the one Windows ships, needed the 5.1
view of each page, not an inference from 7.6.

## Measured, not cited

bash 5.2.21, in this container, 2026-09-27, with a HOME that contains a space:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `echo "~/x"` | `~/x` - quoted, not expanded (agrees with E-06) |
| `echo ~/x` | the home path - unquoted, expanded |
| `echo "$HOME/x"` | the home path - expanded inside double quotes (agrees with E-07) |
| `node "$HOME/.agents/research-kit/bin/preflight.mjs" --help` | runs |
| `node ~/.agents/research-kit/bin/preflight.mjs --help` | runs as well: bash does not word-split the result of tilde expansion |

PowerShell and zsh are not installed here, so their rows rest on their documentation alone.

## How the prior held

Right on everything it predicted, and slightly early on one date. It expected 5.1 to pass `~`
literally, 7.x to expand it only through PSNativeWindowsTildeExpansion, `$HOME` in every
PowerShell, bash and zsh expanding `~` only unquoted, and cmd using `%USERPROFILE%`. It guessed
the feature might be mainstream "by 7.5 or 7.6", and it is 7.6 (E-03). It did not foresee that
bash leaves a tilde-expanded path with a space in it whole (measured above).

## Known unknowns

None. Every blocking unknown was closed with primary-source evidence.

## Decision

**A project that travels spells the kit `$HOME/.agents/research-kit`, and every command is
double-quoted.** `node "$HOME/.agents/research-kit/bin/doctor.mjs"` reaches node as one
absolute path:
- in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and every PowerShell 7 (U-2);
- in bash and zsh (U-3);
- with a space in the home folder in all of them.

`~` does not reach node that way in 5.1, 7.4, or 7.5 without an experimental feature (U-1), and
quoting it (needed for a space in an absolute path) stops bash and zsh expanding it (U-3).

1. `collect.yml` passes `--kit` `$HOME/.agents/research-kit` instead of `~/.agents/research-kit`.
   It is not expanded there, because the argument goes through `execFileSync` with no shell.
2. Every `node {{KIT}}/bin/...` in the template becomes `node "{{KIT}}/bin/..."`. For a local
   project, `{{KIT}}` is an absolute path, and quotes keep a space in it from splitting the
   command (E-05, E-11).
3. START_HERE.md, the operator's file, says what cmd needs: `%USERPROFILE%` in place of `$HOME`
   (U-4). cmd expands neither `~` nor `$HOME`.
4. The kit-root copy of START_HERE.md follows the template. new-project's help shows
   `--kit '$HOME/.agents/research-kit'`, single-quoted so the shell typing it does not expand it.

**Out of scope:** a launcher on PATH, which would avoid the home path altogether. It is a new
installed artifact with its own failure modes, and quoting plus `$HOME` already reach every shell
the kit's readers use.

**First step:** a test that scaffolds with `--kit '$HOME/.agents/research-kit'` and has bash
resolve every command in the project's documents against a home folder that contains a space.

## Next steps

1. Reviewed 2026-09-27; no **TODO** remains.
2. Hand this file to the builder (phase 2). Re-running `node bin/brief.mjs`
   after edits will refuse without `--force` so your judgements are preserved.
