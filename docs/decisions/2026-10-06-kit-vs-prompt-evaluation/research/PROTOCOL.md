# Evaluation protocol — kit vs. strong prompt (frozen before any run)

Design: ADR-0145. Status: **frozen draft** — the tasks, rubrics and simplification
criteria below are committed before the first trial so results cannot bend the criteria.
One amendment path exists: before any trial has run, a rubric defect found while closing
U-1..U-4 may be corrected in a commit that names the defect; after the first trial, the
protocol is immutable and a defect is recorded alongside the results instead.

The rubric terms marked (U-1)..(U-4) take their final operational definitions from the
evidence that closes those unknowns in `DISCOVERY.md`. The structure below does not
change when they close; only the cited definitions are filled in.

## Arms

Matched in everything but the workflow:

- **Arm A — kit.** The full Research-Kit workflow: decompose, contract, collect,
  preflight, brief, handoff, with the commit gate installed and no override.
- **Arm B — strong prompt.** The same model, the same browsing, file, and testing tools,
  and the same total budget, with a prompt instructing: research before consequential
  decisions; save the pages you rely on; preserve uncertainty and contradictions; run
  meaningful tests; report truthfully what was verified, inferred, and unknown; do not
  commit before the research supports the design. Ordinary files and notes; no kit
  machinery. The prompt is committed verbatim in `PROMPT-ARM-B.md` before the first
  trial.

Matched settings: same model and version per trial pair, same tool set, same total
token/credit/time budget per task, recorded per trial. **Trials: 3 per arm per task**
(36 trials per arm) — small enough to afford, enough to see variance; the pilot is
exploratory and is reported as such.

## Tasks — twelve, four per domain

Chosen to include the kit's claimed strongholds — consequential external facts, paid
collection, an interruption mid-task, a cross-machine handoff — and ordinary work where
the kit claims no advantage. Excluding either kind would structurally favor one arm.
Concrete task texts are written in `TASKS/` before the first trial; the slots are fixed
here.

### Research (R1–R4)

- **R1 — consequential external facts.** Recommend a vendor/plan for a stated workload
  where pricing, rate limits and ToS decide the answer; ground truth is the vendors'
  own pages on the trial date.
- **R2 — paid collection under budget.** A research question whose sources require
  metered collection; the budget is set so careless collection exhausts it.
- **R3 — contradictory sources.** A question where authoritative sources disagree; the
  expected outcome records both and says which is trusted and why, not an average.
- **R4 — interruption mid-task.** The session is killed at a scripted midpoint; a fresh
  session must resume. Scored on what survived and whether work was redone or paid for
  twice.

### Coding (C1–C4)

- **C1 — API-dependent implementation.** A small feature whose correctness depends on a
  current external API's actual behavior/limits (the facts must be looked up, not
  recalled).
- **C2 — local bug fix, no new external facts.** The kit's claimed weak spot; included
  so overhead is measured where the kit promises nothing.
- **C3 — tests-pass-but-wrong trap.** A task with a provided initial test suite that a
  plausible wrong implementation passes; graded against an expanded hidden suite (U-3).
- **C4 — cross-machine handoff.** Agent 1 researches and designs on machine 1; agent 2
  implements on machine 2 from whatever agent 1 left behind. Scored on whether agent 2
  needed to re-research or guess.

### Writing (W1–W4)

- **W1 — factual brief with citations.** A short decision memo where every load-bearing
  claim must cite a source that actually supports it (U-2).
- **W2 — revision without new claims.** Edit an existing factual document for clarity;
  scored on whether edits introduced unsupported claims.
- **W3 — uncertainty preservation.** Summarize a body of evidence containing known
  unknowns and one contradiction; scored on whether the summary retains them or
  silently resolves them.
- **W4 — handoff brief.** Produce a handoff another agent then acts on; scored on the
  second agent's outcome, not the brief's tidiness.

## Outcomes and grading

Scored on the **actual final environment state as well as the transcript**, with
repeated trials and graders calibrated per task type (U-1). Per trial:

| Outcome | Measured as |
|---|---|
| Unsupported claims | Load-bearing claims whose cited (or saved) source does not support them, under the U-2 definition; counted by a grader reading claim against source |
| Implementation defects | Defects reaching the final state, including those passing the task's initial tests (U-3 definition); detected by expanded/hidden tests and grader review |
| Truthful reporting | Each reported claim labeled verified / untested / expected checked against the transcript and final state; a "verified" that was not run counts as a truthfulness failure |
| Successful handoffs | For R4, C4, W4: did the receiving agent/session complete without re-research, guessing, or lost material? Lost captures/notes and incomplete transfers are counted |
| Review effort | Grader minutes to confirm or refute the work product |
| Time | Wall-clock per trial |
| Cost | Tokens plus metered collection spend per trial |

Grading rules, fixed now:

- Expected outcome and rubric per task are committed in `TASKS/` **before any run**.
- Graders see the arm label only after scoring (blind-first).
- A task-arm pair's trials are scored by the same rubric version; rubric versions are
  immutable once a trial has used them.
- Tidier documents, more captures, greener protocol checks are **not** outcomes.
- Every result is reported with the status vocabulary: verified (run and seen),
  untested (written, not run), expected (reasoned, not run).

## Pre-registered simplification criteria (decision 4)

Fixed now, per mechanism, so the post-hoc decision cannot be fitted to the results.
"Meaningful" means: observed in more than one trial, not explained by a single outlier,
and large enough that a reviewer reading the trial record would call it a difference in
kind, not noise — the pilot is exploratory, so these are decision rules for the owner's
keep/simplify/drop ADRs, not significance tests.

| Mechanism | Keep if the trials show | Drop or reduce if |
|---|---|---|
| Collector (caching, capture, plan/budget) | Arm B meaningfully more often loses source material, double-pays for collection, or exhausts the budget (R2, R4) | Arm B's saved pages and notes serve review and resumption equally well at lower overhead |
| Ledger integrity (hash chain, tamper evidence) | A real trial event where an unverifiable or altered corpus would have gone unnoticed in Arm B, or graders meaningfully faster verifying Arm A provenance | No trial where integrity checking changed an outcome or review conclusion, and no review-effort advantage |
| Handoff check (`handoff.mjs`, brief) | Arm A's receiving agents meaningfully more often proceed without re-research or guessing (R4, C4, W4), or transfer losses detected in Arm A that Arm B silently suffered | Receiving agents fare equally well from Arm B's ordinary files |
| Commit hook (gate) | Arm A meaningfully fewer premature commits / unsupported-claim commits than Arm B's instructed-to-wait discipline | Instruction alone prevents premature commits equally; or the hook's overhead (blocked legitimate work, overrides taken) exceeds its catches |

Each resulting keep/simplify/drop is recorded as its own ADR confirming or superseding
the prior decisions for that mechanism (ADR-0145, Trigger to revisit).

## Execution order (step 4 of the plan — not yet run)

1. Close U-1..U-4 on the collector machine (`research.mjs --plan research/plan.json`),
   fill the cited definitions above, pass this project's preflight.
2. Write the twelve concrete task texts, expected outcomes and rubrics into `TASKS/`,
   and the verbatim Arm B prompt into `PROMPT-ARM-B.md`; commit before any trial.
3. Run the trials, retaining artifacts and transcripts under this project
   (`results/`, transcripts included; captures through the normal pipeline).
4. Score blind-first, report with status words, write the closing decision document,
   record each mechanism's outcome as an ADR, and flip this project's row in
   `../..`/README.md from `pending` to the status matching what it then backs.

Nothing in this protocol adds a command, check, judge or format to the kit; ADR-0117's
freeze and ADR-0089's semantic boundary remain in force throughout.
